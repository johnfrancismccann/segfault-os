MP2 Bug Log - Christopher Maier, cjmaier2

draw_vert_line:
-for loop increment by i++
    o description: thought it was to increment by IMAGE_SIZE_WIDTH but didn't realize buf is taken from 
	*vert_line_fn, which returns a linear array
    o symptom: scrolling right reproduced left side of image instead of continuing the right side
    o time: a few hours
    o difficulty: change to loop update value

status bar:
-CRTC Registers
    o description: status bar not showing up
    o symptom: I didn't realize you must double the line number that you place in the line compare register
    o time: a few hours
    o difficulty: change to register value

tuxctl-ioctl.c in TUX_SET_LED:
-failed to take into account which LEDs are set
    o description: I was sending each number to the line discipline (with ldisc_put) and forgot that 
	there are times when, if not all LEDs are set to display, that there will be less than 4 bytes of data transferred.
    o symptom: incorrect numbers displayed to tux controller
    o time: a few hours
    o difficulty: moderate, modify algorithm

-ioctl lock
    o description: I didn't take into account a corner case in which the spinlock I use in ioctl never is unlocked.
    o symptom: my code was looping infinitely and printing the same command over and over
    o time: a few hours
    o difficulty: pretty difficult

tuxctl-ioctl.c:
-up makes image go down, move right makes image go up, all other buttons cause image to shake
    o description: faulty algorithm for converting MTCP_BIOC_EVENT to correct format to send to screen
    o time: a few hours
    o symptom: buttons incorrectly moving image
    o difficulty: medium

printing screen:
-print statements still in code
    o description: screen was continuously shaking/displaying incorrectly
    o time: a few minutes
    o symptom: I had print statements still in my code left from testing and debugging. 
	Had to comment them out/delete them to get rid of problem.
    o difficulty: not that difficult.

input.c:
-can't use arrow keys on keyboard but can type
    o description: my logic was incorrect in converting the 8-bit representation of pressed 
	buttons to the actual commands implemented in the screen.
    o time: a few hours
    o symptom: not able to use TUX and keyboard correctly
    o difficulty: medium

input.c:
-I was trying to switch the left and down bits in byte 2 of the returned value from MTCP_BIOC 
	but did so without using a new variable when switching, which caused it to be switched with every call, 
	switching left and down every time and causing diagonal down/left movement
    o description: my logic had an error for converting the 2 8-bit packets from MTCP_BIOC_EVENT 
	to the one 8-bit representation for TUX_SET_LED
    o time: too long...a few hours...
    o symptom: pressing down or left causes image to move diagonally down/left
    o difficulty: easy

input.c:
-didn't use thread for time
    o description: I didn't realize we need a thread for time (foolish mistake) 
	and that it doesn't just work when you put the update time function in a while loop
    o time: a few hours
    o symptom: TUX only displays 0:00 as time (doesn't display incremented time)
    o difficulty: medium/difficult

input.c
-time incrementing incorrectly
    o description: I forgot that the number passed into TUX_SET should be in hex
    o time: a few minutes
    o symptom: incrementing the minutes from 0 to 6, etc.
    o difficulty: easy
