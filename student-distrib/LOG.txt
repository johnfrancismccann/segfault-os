   /* I will modify types.h file
    I added something about dentry_t, which is a 64B data type*/
    
    Well, I'll just assume dentry_t is already defined for now

    NO ITS NOT :(

Here are all the references I have already read:

The things need to do are already written as comments in test.c, task_execute
http://wiki.osdev.org/Task_State_Segment
Intel IA32-ref-manual-vol-3   6-5; pay attention to the instruction for SS0 and ESP0
TSS as well as TSS descriptor structure are defined in x86_desc.h
my understanding is, you make changes to TSS instead of either:1. movl new value to the registers
                                                            or:2. push the new values onto the kernel stack
															
It seems that you have to call IRET after execution of the execute system call, but I don't know where and how

def of struct_task is in task.h
I think the only thing we have to do in task.c is the execution function, you guys can delete others
