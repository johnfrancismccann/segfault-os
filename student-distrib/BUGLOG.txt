Team SegFault Bug Log

1:
SYMPTOM:    Boot fails at LJMP instruction.
TIME SPENT: 6 hours
SOLUTION:   In our LGDT statement, we were loading an incorrect
            value into GDTR.  This caused the jump to go to an
            invalid address, crashing the OS.  By changing the
            GDTR value, we successfully initialized the GDT and
            booted the OS.
