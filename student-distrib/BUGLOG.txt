Team SegFault Bug Log

1:
SYMPTOM:    Boot fails at LJMP instruction.
TIME SPENT: 6 hours
SOLUTION:   In our LGDT statement, we were loading an incorrect
            value into GDTR.  This caused the jump to go to an
            invalid address, crashing the OS.  By changing the
            GDTR value, we successfully initialized the GDT and
            booted the OS.

2:
SYMPTOM:    General Protection exception is raised repeatedly
TIME SPENT: 30 minutes
SOLUTION:   When initializing the PIC, we failed to mask the interrupts
            before any of the interrupt handlers were created.
            This caused a rogue interrupt to be triggered, which
            called an unwritten handler at an undefined memory
            location, causing an interrupt.  Masking HW interrupts
            fixed the problem.

3:
SYMPTOM:    rtc.S doesn't compile with rtc.c
TIME SPENT:	2 hours
SOLUTION:   The provided makefile compiles .S and .c files into separate
            .o files, which causes the linker to think that functions are
            either undefined or defined multiple times.  By changing
            rtc.S to rtc_asm.S and adding a new header file, rtc_asm.h, 
            we were able to link the assemly and c files to compile into
            one big, happy OS kernel.
